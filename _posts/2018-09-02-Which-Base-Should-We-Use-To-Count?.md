> To use this demo, you first select which base you want to use by moving the mouse up and down while clicking on the grey box at the far right. After This, you will be given a problem of transferring some amount of coins (get a new problem at any time by pressing 'n'). To pick up 3 coins from a pile of 5, simply click on the third coin down in the pile. You can place coins down by clicking on the triangle above the pile you wish to add them to. You can convert coins by clicking on the red square under the conversion you wish to perform (it goes both ways, always giving you a different colour than what you started with). 

This simple game was my submission for the third assignment for [comp1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/). I got the idea to make this game when trying to explain base 2 to a 14 year old student. What I realised after many hours of explaining was that he 'knew' all the facts, but those facts didn't equal understanding. In short, he didn't have a narrative to tie all the facts together. What I personally took away from this was that base 2 is definitely the best base for a number system. All the other bases are so much harder!
